An Introduction To the Dataset:

This dataset contains a collectin of recipes from Food.com, originally gathered and used in a research paper on recommender systems. It consists of two primary components: recipes and interactions. The recipes dataset includes details such as ingredients, preparation time, and nutrition information, while the interactions dataset provides a record of reviews and ratings for the recipes. Due to the large quantity of data, these data are a subset of the original dataset, focusing on recipes and reviews posted since 2008. By merging the recipes and interactions datasets, one can analyze the popularity of recipes and identify trends in recipe charactersitics. The data provides valuable insightinto user preferences, rating behaviours, and recipe features, making it a useful resource to explore recipe trends.
